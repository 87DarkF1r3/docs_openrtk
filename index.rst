OpenRTK is an integrated GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) high precision 
chip and precisely calibrated Inertial Measurement Unit open-source platform for 
the development of navigation and localization algorithms. Users are able to quickly 
develop and deploy custom navigation/localization algorithms and custom sensor integrations 
on top of the OpenRTK platform.  OpenRTK also has pre-built drivers in Python as well as 
a developer website - Aceinna Navigation Studio (ANS). These tools make logging and plotting data, 
including custom data structures and packets very simple.
