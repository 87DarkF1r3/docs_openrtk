Who is using it?
================

OpenRTK is to be used for commercial applications in agriculture, transportation, unmanned vehicles, 
machine control, marine navigation, and other industries where efficiencies can be gained from the 
application of precise, continually available position and time information.

**Unmanned Vehicles**

Initially, unmanned vehicles were used primarily by the defense industry. However, as the unmanned 
vehicle market has grown and diversified, the commercial use of unmanned vehicles has also grown 
and diversified. Some of the current civilian uses for unmanned vehicles are: search and rescue, 
crop monitoring, wildlife conservation, aerial photography, environmental research, infrastructure 
inspection, bathymetry, landmine detection and disposal, HAZMAT inspection and disaster management. 
As the civilian unmanned vehicle market expands, so will the civilian use of unmanned vehicles.

**Machine Control**

GNSS technology is being integrated into equipment such as bulldozers, excavators, graders, pavers 
and farm machinery to enhance productivity in the realtime operation of this equipment, and to provide 
situational awareness information to the equipment operator. The adoption of GNSS-based machine 
control is similar in its impact to the earlier adoption of hydraulics technology in machinery, which 
has had a profound effect on productivity and reliability.

**Precise Agriculture**

In precision agriculture, GNSS-based applications are used to support farm planning, field mapping, 
soil sampling, tractor guidance, and crop assessment. More precise application of fertilizers, pesticides 
and herbicides reduces cost and environmental impact. GNSS applications can automatically guide farm 
implements along the contours of the earth in a manner that controls erosion and maximizes the effectiveness 
of irrigation systems. Farm machinery can be operated at higher speeds, day and night, with increased 
accuracy. This increased accuracy saves time and fuel, and maximizes the efficiency of the operation. 
Operator safety is also increased by greatly reducing fatigue.
