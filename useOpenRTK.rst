How to use OpenRTK?
===================

The OpenRTK module acts as a NTRIP client fetching GNSS corrections data
from a NTRIP server of a GNSS correction service provider. This connectivity
requires the OpenRTK module sending out its current position via NMEA GGA 
every one second to the NTRIP server over the internet. The relevant configuration of
data transmission depends on the moblie APP/PC platform. In addition, OpenRTK (includes 
moblie APP and PC platform) can show trajectory in map.
