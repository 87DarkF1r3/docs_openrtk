Aceinna Cloud Server
====================

Aceinna Cloud server includes Aceinna Network, Aceinna Computing Server 
and Aceinna Ntrip Caster. Aceinna Cloud server provides high precision 
correction data in an open standard format (RTCM) simply by connecting 
any GNSS-enabled devices over internet. This correction data are used 
on the GNSS device to enhance its position even down to a centimetre 
based on RTK technology. The advantages clearly outperform the old and 
complicated process of reference station setup and maintenance. Furthermore, 
Aceinna Cloud server also supports cloudRTK mode, instead of receiving correction data, 
GNSS device transmits observation to Aceinna Cloud server. Aceinna Computing Server 
will do RTK for customers and return centimetre-level position.
