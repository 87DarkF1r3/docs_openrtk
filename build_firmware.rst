  * *Ubuntu* - as follows 

    * Clone the github repo on `Open Source STLink Tools <https://github.com/texane/stlink>`_ and read the instructions carefully.

    * Run the following commands to install ST-LINK V2 driver

        .. code:: bash

            # Run from source directory stlink/
            $ make Release
            $ cd build/Release
            $ sudo make install

            # Plug ST-LINK/V2 into USB, and check the device is present
            $ ls /dev/stlink-v2

* **Hardware**

Import and Build Firmware from Source 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. **Open Aceinna Navigation Studio on VS Code**
   
  After installation of "Aceinna" extension, go to the lest most menu bar and click the "ant" icon of PlatformIO extension, it will bring up panel 1 and 2 (red numbered blue rectangle areas in the following figure) of PlatformIO, and then click "Quick Access->PIO Home->Open" will bring up the "Aceinna Navigation Studio" home page

    .. image:: media/AceinnaPlatformIOHome.jpg

  Alternatively, you can click the "Home" icon in blue rectangle #4 to bring up the home page.
  
2. **Import or Open Project** 

  The required example will be imported into working directory in folder:

    <PlatformIO Installaton Folder>/platformio/Projects/ProjectName

    Now you can edit, build and test the project. All your changes will remain in the above-mentioned directory and subdirectories.
    Next time when you return to development - open Aceinna "Home" page and click "Open Project", choose "Projects" and select
    required project from the list.

    The source tree of imported project tree has the following structure:

    ::

        project directory -|
                           |
                           |                                   
                           |--- .pio --|
                           |           |-- build --|   
                           |           |           |-- board-|

                           |           |                     |-- elf image (firmware.elf)  
                           |           |                     .

                           |                                 |      
                           |                                 |--library1 src tree
                           |                                 |   
                           |                                 |--library2 src tree
                           |                                 |   
                           |                                 |--library3 src tree
                           |                                 |   
                           |                                 .  
                           |                                 .  
                           |                                            
                           |                                            
                           |--include (optional user include files)              
                           |                                            
                           |--lib (optional user library directory tree)
                           |
                           |--src (user source files tree)
                           |


3. **Compile and Load Firmware via JTAG**

 Once you have imported an example project, a good first step is to compile and download this application using your ST-LINK. At the bottom of the VS Code window is the shortcut toolbar shown below.  To load an application to the OpenRTK330 with JTAG, simply click the Install/Download button while the ST-LINK is connected to your EVB.
